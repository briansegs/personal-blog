## Introduction

This Personal Blog is a website where I document my progress transitioning from a 3D Artist to a Software Engineer. This site lets you learn about my journey in a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate way.

My Personal Blog is a project I got to start from scratch! In this project, I utilized my HTML and CSS skills to build out a personal blog website, including custom images, layout, styling, and a design system. Along with webpage design considerations, I worked to appropriately structure my files, as well as use proper CSS and HTML formatting & style.

The blog is live and can be found here -> [Personal Blog](https://briansegs.github.io/personal-blog/)
